Cybersecurity Class – Day 1 Summary

Date: [15/06/2025]

Topics Covered:

1. Categories of Hackers:
• White Hat – Ethical hackers who assist organizations in strengthening their cybersecurity.
• Black Hat – Malicious actors who exploit system weaknesses for personal or financial gain.
• Gray Hat – Hackers who may cross legal boundaries but don’t act with malicious intent.
• Green Hat – Newcomers who are keen to learn the art of hacking.
• Blue Hat – Individuals motivated by revenge or those who help test systems pre-release.
• Script Kiddies – Inexperienced users who use existing tools/scripts without deep technical understanding.

2. Stages of a Hack:
• Reconnaissance – Gathering preliminary data on the target.
• Scanning – Detecting open ports, services, and system vulnerabilities.
• Gaining Access – Exploiting discovered flaws to infiltrate a system.
• Maintaining Access – Ensuring continued control through methods like backdoors.
• Covering Tracks – Hiding evidence to avoid being detected or traced.

3. Threat Types:
• Malware – Includes viruses, worms, and trojans.
• Ransomware – Blocks access to data unless a ransom is paid.
• Spyware & Adware – Gathers user data or delivers unwanted ads.
• Social Engineering – Manipulating people into revealing confidential info.
• Insider Threats – Internal personnel posing a risk to security.
• Zero-Day Exploits – Attacks on previously unknown vulnerabilities.

4. Common Attack Techniques:
• Phishing – Deceiving users to obtain sensitive information.
• Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) – Intercepting data during communication exchanges.
• Keylogging – Tracking user keystrokes to steal credentials.
• Brute Force Attacks – Attempting multiple password combinations until successful.
• Session Hijacking – Taking over a valid session between user and system.
• SQL Injection – Exploiting database vulnerabilities through malicious queries.

5. Cybersecurity Roles and Teams:
• Red Team – Offensive group that emulates real-world attacks to uncover flaws.
• Blue Team – Defensive unit responsible for protecting and monitoring systems.
• Purple Team – Facilitates collaboration between red and blue teams to optimize defense.
• (Optional) Yellow/Green Teams – Focused on embedding security into software design and development stages.

Additional Key Concepts:
• CIA Triad – The three core principles of security: Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability
• Popular Tools – Examples include Wireshark, Nmap, and Burp Suite
• Security Best Practices – Emphasized the importance of strong passwords and 2FA
• Linux Basics – Introduction to using the terminal for security tasks
• Virtual Lab Setup – Brief overview of using virtual machines and Kali Linux
• Ethical Hacking & Legal Boundaries – Initial insight into hacking ethics and related laws

Reflection:
Today’s class provided a thorough introduction to the cybersecurity landscape, including hacker profiles, attack phases, threat types, and team roles. It blended foundational theory with practical relevance, building a strong base for more interactive, hands-on experiences in the days ahead.
