Tip: Make sure your computer has at least 10–15 GB of free space available before starting.

  Step 1: Installing Oracle VirtualBox
Open the VirtualBox installer you downloaded.
If a prompt appears for admin access, click Yes.
When the setup wizard launches, hit Next.
On the Custom Setup screen, keep the default settings and click Next again.
You might get a Network Interfaces Warning—click Yes to proceed.
If a Missing Dependencies warning pops up, continue by clicking Yes.
On the next screen, click Install to begin installation.
Once complete, click Finish.

Installation Troubleshooting
Issue 1: Visual C++ Dependency Missing
Error Message: Missing Microsoft Visual C++ 2015–2022 Redistributable

Fix:
Download the required package:
https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe
Install the redistributable.
Restart the VirtualBox installation.

Issue 2: AMD-V Virtualization Disabled
Error Message: “AMD-V is disabled by BIOS or host OS.”
Fix:Reboot your system and access the BIOS settings.
Use the correct key based on your laptop brand:
Dell: F2 / F12
Lenovo: F1 / F2 or Fn + F2
Acer: DEL / F2
HP: Esc / F10
Go to Advanced Settings, find Virtualization or SVM Mode, and enable it.
Save changes and exit BIOS.

Step 2: Install 7-Zip File Archiver
Right-click on the 7-Zip installer and choose Run as Administrator.
In the installation window, click Install.
Once done, click Close.

Step 3: Extract Kali Linux VirtualBox Image
Navigate to the folder where the Kali image file (.7z) is saved.
Right-click on it, choose Show more options → 7-Zip → Extract Here.
Wait for extraction to finish (this may take a few minutes depending on system speed).

  Step 4: Launching Kali Linux in VirtualBox
(Optional) Create a separate disk partition (10–15 GB) for storing the Kali virtual machine.
Reference: How to create partitions – YouTube Guide
Move the extracted files to the new partition.
Inside the extracted folder, locate:
The .vbox file (VirtualBox Machine Definition)
The .vdi file (Virtual Disk Image)
Double-click the .vbox file—this opens the virtual machine in Oracle VirtualBox.
Click Start to run the VM. The initial boot may take some time.
Once the system starts, use the following credentials to log in:
Username: kali
Password: kali

  Summary:
In today’s class, we focused on setting up a working virtual lab environment using Oracle VirtualBox and Kali Linux. The instructor demonstrated step-by-step how to install necessary tools, resolve common installation issues, and boot up Kali Linux for the first time. This foundational setup is essential for practicing ethical hacking and hands-on cybersecurity tasks in the coming sessions.
